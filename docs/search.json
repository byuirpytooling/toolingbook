Released in February 2024, UV has revolutionized Python packaging through:\n\nCategorical speed improvements: Operations that took minutes now take milliseconds\nUnified tooling: Replaces pip, pip-tools, pipx, pipenv, pyenv, virtualenv, and more\nAutomatic Python management: Downloads and manages Python interpreters\nCross-platform lock files: Same lock file works on Windows, macOS, and Linux\nZero configuration: Smart defaults that just work\n\n\n\nVersion Compatibility Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUV Version\nPython\nStatus\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n0.5.x\n3.8-3.13\nCurrent\nBuild backend changed from uv to uv_build\n\n\n0.4.x\n3.8-3.13\nSupported\nStable, widely deployed\n\n\n0.3.x\n3.8-3.12\nLegacy\nMissing key features\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Warnings\n⚠️ UV is under active development. While stable for production use, APIs and behavior may change between minor versions.\n⚠️ Build isolation issues: Some packages (notably ML libraries like torch with flash-attention) may require special handling with --no-build-isolation.\n⚠️ Not suitable for: Library development requiring testing across multiple Python versions simultaneously (use tox), or Conda environments.\n\n\nUV vs Traditional Tools - Complete Comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nTraditional Approach\nUV Approach\nTime Savings\n\n\n\n\nInstall Python\npyenv/asdf/system packages\nuv (automatic)\n5-30 min → 0\n\n\nCreate virtualenv\npython -m venv\nuv sync (automatic)\n30s → 0\n\n\nInstall deps\npip install -r requirements.txt\nuv sync\n1-5 min → 2s\n\n\nAdd dependency\nEdit file + pip install\nuv add package\n30s → 2s\n\n\nLock deps\npip freeze/pip-tools\nuv lock (automatic)\n2-5 min → &lt;1s\n\n\nUpdate all deps\nComplex pip-tools workflow\nuv lock --upgrade\n5-10 min → &lt;1s\n\n\nRun in env\nsource venv/bin/activate && cmd\nuv run cmd\nManual → Automatic\n\n\nInstall tool\npipx install\nuvx tool\n30s → 2s"

    "text": "Project Setup and Structure\n\nChoosing a Project Layout\nWhen setting up a Python application, you have three main choices:\n\nSrc Layout (recommended for applications and libraries)\nFlat Layout (simpler but with caveats)\n\nMonorepo Layout (multiple related packages)\n\n\n\nSrc Layout (Recommended)\nhello-svc/\n├── src/                    # Unimportable directory\n│   └── hello_svc/         # Your package\n│       ├── __init__.py    # Empty file marking as package\n│       ├── views.py       # Web views/routes\n│       ├── models.py      # Data models\n│       └── asgi.py        # ASGI entry point\n├── tests/\n│   ├── unit/\n│   │   └── test_models.py\n│   └── integration/\n│       └── test_api.py\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── uv.lock\n├── README.md\n└── .gitignore\nBenefits of src layout: - Import hygiene: Can’t accidentally import from working directory - Clear boundaries: Source code is isolated - Test safety: Tests only see installed code - Tool compatibility: Works with all Python tools\n\n\nFlat Layout\nmyapp/\n├── myapp/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── main.py\n├── tests/\n├── pyproject.toml\n└── uv.lock\nWhen to use: - Quick scripts - Simple applications - When you understand the import implications\nCaveats: - Can accidentally import from working directory - May need PYTHONPATH adjustments - Some tools assume src layout\n\n\nMonorepo Layout\nFor organizations managing multiple related packages:\nmonorepo/\n├── packages/\n│   ├── core/\n│   │   ├── src/company_core/\n│   │   ├── tests/\n│   │   └── pyproject.toml\n│   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── src/company_api/\n│   │   ├── tests/\n│   │   └── pyproject.toml\n│   └── cli/\n│       ├── src/company_cli/\n│       ├── tests/\n│       └── pyproject.toml\n├── pyproject.toml          # Workspace configuration\n└── uv.lock                 # Shared lock file\nWorkspace root pyproject.toml:\n[tool.uv]\nworkspace = [\"packages/*\"]\n\n[project]\nname = \"company-workspace\"\nversion = \"0\"\nrequires-python = \"==3.13.*\"\nCore package packages/core/pyproject.toml:\n[project]\nname = \"company-core\"\nversion = \"0\"\ndependencies = []\nAPI package that depends on core packages/api/pyproject.toml:\n[project]\nname = \"company-api\"\nversion = \"0\"\ndependencies = [\n    \"company-core\",  # Declare the dependency\n    \"fastapi&gt;=0.100\",\n]\n\n[tool.uv.sources]\n# Tell UV to find company-core in the workspace\ncompany-core = { workspace = true }\nCLI package that depends on both packages/cli/pyproject.toml:\n[project]\nname = \"company-cli\"\nversion = \"0\"\ndependencies = [\n    \"company-core\",\n    \"company-api\",\n    \"click&gt;=8.0\",\n]\n\n[tool.uv.sources]\n# All workspace dependencies must be declared here\ncompany-core = { workspace = true }\ncompany-api = { workspace = true }\nKey points about workspace dependencies: 1. Dependencies must be listed in dependencies array 2. Workspace packages must also be declared in [tool.uv.sources] 3. Use { workspace = true } to tell UV to find them locally 4. External dependencies don’t need sources entries\n\n\nNamespace Packages\nFor large organizations using namespace packages:\nsrc/\n└── company/\n    ├── __init__.py         # This file can be empty or omitted\n    └── teamname/\n        ├── __init__.py\n        └── module.py\nImportant: For namespace packages: - Parent __init__.py can be empty or omitted entirely - Each team owns their subdirectory - Multiple packages can contribute to same namespace\nExample structure across multiple packages:\n# Package: company-auth\nsrc/company/auth/\n\n# Package: company-billing  \nsrc/company/billing/\n\n# Both importable as:\n# from company.auth import login\n# from company.billing import invoice\n\n\nEntry Points Philosophy\nEntry points are crucial boundaries between systems. They act as “leaf modules” - the terminal nodes of your import graph that are never imported by other modules. This makes them the perfect (and only) place for side-effecting initialization code.\nKey principles: - Entry points are leaf modules (never imported by other code) - They bridge between external world and your application - They’re the ONLY place for side-effects (logging setup, configuration, database connections) - They should remain as simple as possible (no business logic) - Each entry point represents a different way to run your application\nStandard entry points:\n# src/myapp/asgi.py - For async web apps (leaf module)\nimport logging\nfrom .app import create_app\n\n# Side effects belong ONLY here\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\napp = create_app()\n\n# src/myapp/wsgi.py - For sync web apps (leaf module)\nimport os\nimport atexit\nimport logging\nfrom .app import create_app\n\n# All initialization in the leaf module\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\napp, cleanup = create_app()\natexit.register(cleanup)\n\n# src/myapp/cli.py - For command-line interfaces (leaf module)\nimport sys\nimport logging\nfrom .commands import main\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n    sys.exit(main())\n\n# src/myapp/worker.py - For job queues (leaf module)\nimport logging\nfrom .tasks import worker\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n    worker.run()\nWhy this pattern matters: - Testability: Tests can import your modules without triggering side effects - Flexibility: Different entry points can have different configurations - Clarity: It’s obvious where initialization happens - Safety: No accidental side effects from imports\n\n\nFile Organization Best Practices\nproject/\n├── src/package/\n│   ├── __init__.py        # Package marker\n│   ├── api/               # Web endpoints\n│   ├── core/              # Business logic\n│   ├── db/                # Database models\n│   ├── services/          # External integrations\n│   └── utils/             # Shared utilities\n├── tests/\n│   ├── conftest.py        # Pytest configuration\n│   ├── unit/              # Fast, isolated tests\n│   ├── integration/       # Database/API tests\n│   └── e2e/               # Full system tests\n├── scripts/               # Development/deployment scripts\n├── docs/                  # Documentation\n├── .github/               # GitHub Actions\n└── docker/                # Docker configurations"

Here’s a complete example:\n[project]\nname = \"hello-svc\"\nversion = \"0\"  # For applications, version doesn't matter\nrequires-python = \"==3.13.*\"  # Exact version for applications\ndependencies = [\n    \"fastapi\",\n    \"granian\",  # Rust-based ASGI server\n    \"stamina\",  # For retries\n]\n\n[dependency-groups]\ndev = [\n    \"pytest\",\n    \"fastapi[standard]\",  # FastAPI with dev server features\n]\n\n[build-system]\n# Version pinning is crucial for reproducibility - avoids unexpected build failures if uv_build has breaking changes\nrequires = [\"uv_build&gt;=0.7.15,&lt;0.8.0\"]\nbuild-backend = \"uv_build\"\n\nKey Configuration Points\n\nProject Name: Can use dashes or underscores (normalized to dashes internally)\nVersion: Set to “0” for applications that aren’t distributed\nPython Version: Use exact version for applications (==3.13.*) - this pins the minor version (preventing automatic upgrades to e.g., 3.14 which might introduce breaking changes) while still allowing security patch updates (3.13.0 → 3.13.1)\nDependencies: Only production dependencies in main list\nDependency Groups: Development tools go in [dependency-groups]\nBuild System: Use uv_build (with underscore) as the build backend with proper version constraints\n\n\n\nDependency Groups vs Extras\n\nDependency Groups (PEP 735): For development dependencies not part of package\nExtras: Part of package metadata, visible on PyPI\nGroups named “dev” are automatically installed by UV unless told otherwise\n\n\n\nBottom-Pinning vs Top-Pinning\nUV uses bottom-pinning (&gt;=current_version) instead of top-pinning (^current_version):\n# UV adds dependencies like this:\nfastapi = \"&gt;=0.104.1\"  # Bottom-pinned\n\n# NOT like this:\nfastapi = \"^0.104.1\"   # Top-pinned (blocks major updates)\nWhy bottom-pinning is superior: - Security updates: You get security fixes even if they’re only in major version bumps - Calendar versioning: Works with projects using date-based versions (e.g., 2024.1.0) - Resolution speed: Limits eligible versions, making dependency resolution faster - Lock file safety: Actual versions are locked in uv.lock, so updates are intentional\nThe lock file provides the stability, while bottom-pinning provides the flexibility.\n\n\n💡 Understanding uv lock vs. uv pip compile\nThis guide focuses on UV’s “project mode,” which uses uv.lock and is the recommended modern workflow.\n\nuv lock / uv sync: Works with pyproject.toml and the uv.lock file. This is the integrated, cross-platform, “all-in-one” solution.\nuv pip compile / uv pip sync: A powerful replacement for pip-tools. It reads requirements.in or pyproject.toml and produces a traditional requirements.txt file. This is excellent for migrating legacy projects or for teams that want to maintain a requirements.txt workflow with UV’s speed.\n\nFor new projects, stick with the uv lock workflow as shown in this guide. The pip interface is primarily a migration tool and compatibility layer."

    "text": "Docker Integration\nUV revolutionizes Python Docker builds with: - Optimized layer caching using --no-install-project - No Python base image required - UV can download Python itself! - Deterministic builds with lock files - Blazing fast rebuilds when only code changes\n\nDevelopment Dockerfile\n# Development image with hot reload\nFROM python:3.13-slim\n\n# Install UV\nCOPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/uv\n\n# Copy project files\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./\n\n# Install dependencies (including dev)\nRUN uv sync\n\n# Copy source code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Development server with reload\nCMD [\"uv\", \"run\", \"fastapi\", \"dev\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\"]\n\n\nProduction Dockerfile (Multi-stage)\n# Build stage for dependencies\nFROM python:3.13-slim AS builder\n\n# Install UV\nCOPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/uv\n\n# Copy ONLY dependency definition files\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./\n\n# Install dependencies into a layer. This layer only changes\n# when the lock file changes.\n# --no-install-project prevents installing the app itself here.\nRUN uv sync --no-dev --no-editable --no-install-project\n\n# Final image stage\nFROM python:3.13-slim\n\n# Create non-root user\nRUN useradd -m -u 1000 appuser\n\n# Copy the dependency environment from the builder\nCOPY --from=builder /app/.venv /app/.venv\n\n# Set PATH to use the venv\nENV PATH=\"/app/.venv/bin:$PATH\"\n\n# Now copy the application code. This is the most frequently\n# changing layer and should be last.\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --chown=appuser:appuser src ./src\n\n# Health check\nHEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \\\n  CMD python -c \"import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health')\"\n\nUSER appuser\n\n# Run with production server\nCMD [\"gunicorn\", \"src.myapp.asgi:app\", \"-k\", \"uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker\", \"--bind\", \"0.0.0.0:8000\"]\nKey optimization: The --no-install-project flag creates a more stable dependency layer that only changes when uv.lock changes, not when your application code changes. This results in much faster builds during development.\n\n\nOptimized Dockerfile (Using UV for everything)\nFROM ubuntu:24.04\n\n# Install minimal dependencies\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    curl \\\n    ca-certificates \\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Install UV\nRUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\nENV PATH=\"/root/.cargo/bin:$PATH\"\n\n# Create app user\nRUN useradd -m -u 1000 appuser\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy project files\nCOPY --chown=appuser:appuser pyproject.toml uv.lock ./\n\n# UV will download Python!\nRUN uv sync --no-dev\n\n# Copy application\nCOPY --chown=appuser:appuser . .\n\n# Switch to non-root user\nUSER appuser\n\n# Run with UV\nCMD [\"uv\", \"run\", \"gunicorn\", \"src.myapp.asgi:app\", \"-k\", \"uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker\"]\n\n\nMinimal Dockerfile (UV Downloads Python!)\nHere’s the “wow” feature - UV can download and manage Python itself:\n# No Python base image needed!\nFROM ubuntu:24.04\n\n# Minimal setup\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nRUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\nENV PATH=\"/root/.cargo/bin:$PATH\"\n\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./\n\n# UV will download Python based on requires-python in pyproject.toml\n# and create the .venv\nRUN uv sync --no-dev\n\nCOPY . .\nCMD [\"uv\", \"run\", \"gunicorn\", \"src.myapp.asgi:app\", \"-k\", \"uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker\"]\nThis is revolutionary: No need to worry about Python base images, versions, or OS-specific Python installations. UV handles it all based on your requires-python setting!\n\n\nDocker Layer Caching Optimization\n# Maximize cache hits with proper layer ordering\nFROM python:3.13-slim\n\n# Install UV (rarely changes)\nCOPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/uv\n\n# Copy only dependency files first\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./\n\n# Install dependencies WITHOUT the project (cached when deps unchanged)\nRUN uv sync --no-dev --no-install-project\n\n# Copy source last (changes frequently)\nCOPY src ./src\n\n# Now sync the project itself\nRUN uv sync --no-dev --no-editable\n\n# Build-time optimizations\nRUN UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1 python -m compileall src\n\nCMD [\"uv\", \"run\", \"python\", \"-m\", \"myapp\"]\nLayer caching best practices: 1. Order layers from least to most frequently changing 2. Use --no-install-project to separate dependency installation from project installation 3. Copy source code as late as possible 4. Each RUN command creates a new layer - combine commands when they change together\n\n\nDocker Compose Integration\n# docker-compose.yml\nversion: '3.8'\n\nservices:\n  web:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile.dev\n      cache_from:\n        - ${REGISTRY}/myapp:cache\n    volumes:\n      - .:/app\n      - /app/.venv  # Don't override venv\n    environment:\n      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/myapp\n    ports:\n      - \"8000:8000\"\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n\n  worker:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile.prod\n    command: uv run celery -A myapp worker\n    environment:\n      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:16\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass\n      - POSTGRES_USER=user\n      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp\n    volumes:\n      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\n  redis:\n    image: redis:7-alpine\n\nvolumes:\n  postgres_data:\n\n\nKubernetes Deployment\n# deployment.yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: myapp\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: myapp\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: myapp\n    spec:\n      securityContext:\n        runAsNonRoot: true\n        runAsUser: 1000\n        fsGroup: 1000\n      containers:\n      - name: myapp\n        image: myregistry/myapp:latest\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 8000\n        env:\n        - name: UV_NO_CACHE\n          value: \"1\"  # Disable cache in container\n        - name: DATABASE_URL\n          valueFrom:\n            secretKeyRef:\n              name: myapp-secrets\n              key: database-url\n        resources:\n          requests:\n            memory: \"256Mi\"\n            cpu: \"100m\"\n          limits:\n            memory: \"512Mi\"\n            cpu: \"500m\"\n        livenessProbe:\n          httpGet:\n            path: /health\n            port: 8000\n          initialDelaySeconds: 30\n          periodSeconds: 10\n        readinessProbe:\n          httpGet:\n            path: /ready\n            port: 8000\n          initialDelaySeconds: 5\n          periodSeconds: 5\n\n\nContainer Security Best Practices\n\nAlways use non-root user\nMinimize image size - Use slim base images\nScan for vulnerabilities:\ndocker scout cves myimage:latest\nSign images: Use Docker Content Trust\nUse specific versions: Never use latest in production\nSecrets management: Use environment variables or mounted secrets, never hardcode\n\n\n\nPerformance Considerations\n# Enable bytecode compilation\nENV UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1\n\n# Use BuildKit cache mounts\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\nRUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \\\n    uv sync --no-dev\n\n# Multi-platform builds\n# Build with: docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64\nWhich Dockerfile approach to choose? - Development: Use the simple development Dockerfile with hot reload - Production with Python base: Use the optimized multi-stage build with --no-install-project - Minimal/Revolutionary: Use the Ubuntu-based approach where UV downloads Python - perfect for CI/CD or when you want full control\n\n\nTroubleshooting Guide\nVirtual environment issues:\n# Complete reset using Just recipe\njust fresh  # If you have the recipe\n\n# Or manually\nrm -rf .venv __pycache__ .pytest_cache .coverage .mypy_cache\nuv sync\nLock file conflicts after merge:\n# After git merge conflicts\ngit checkout --theirs uv.lock  # Or --ours\nuv lock --upgrade\nModule not found errors: 1. Ensure using uv run or activated venv 2. Check pyproject.toml has all dependencies 3. For src layout: verify correct import paths 4. Run uv sync to ensure sync\nSlow first run: - First time: UV downloads Python, creates venv, installs deps - Subsequent runs: Sub-second - Use UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE=only-system to skip Python download\nPackage build failures:\n# For packages with complex build requirements\nuv sync --no-build-isolation\n\n# For specific package issues\nUV_NO_CACHE=1 uv sync  # Force rebuild\nCommon gotchas: - Always use -m form with CLI tools: uv run -m pytest, not uv run pytest - The --with flag requires -m form for CLI entry points - Check pyproject.toml for correct uv_build version constraints\n\n\nIDE Integration\nUV’s .venv location makes IDE integration automatic:\nVS Code: - Automatically detects .venv in project root - Python extension uses it immediately - No configuration needed\nPyCharm: - Detects .venv on project open - May prompt to use it as interpreter - Works with all PyCharm features\nOther Editors: - Point to .venv/bin/python (Unix) or .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe (Windows) - UV maintains standard virtualenv structure\nTip: When using IDEs, you can still use uv run -m pytest in the integrated terminal for consistency, or let the IDE use the .venv directly.\n\n\nUV Scripts (Advanced Feature)\nUV supports inline script dependencies:\n#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"&gt;=3.12\"\n# dependencies = [\"requests\", \"rich\"]\n# ///\n\nimport requests\nfrom rich import print\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.github.com\")\nprint(response.json())\nMake executable and run directly - UV handles everything!"

[Packages] save you time. Even if you don’t intend to share your package with others, they help you easily reuse and maintain your code across multiple projects.",
