- What is different from the R experience?

## Exploring uv

- [uv installation guide](uv_setup.qmd)

## Building or first Python package

[Explore our template repo](https://github.com/byuirpytooling/pypackage_template)

- Where are the python functions for the package?
- Where is the documentation?
- Let's see if we can build our python simplemaths functions.
- What do we need to change for this package to work?

## Class Assignments

 1. Make sure your environment is setup and that you can publish to GitHub pages
 2. Read through The [Python Package book](https://py-pkgs.org/welcome)
  - Note: We are using uv instead of poetry.
  - Note: We are using mkdocs-meterial for documentation instead.
 3. Create your own package repository for your personal Python package.
